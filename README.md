Electric Vehicle Data Analysis dashboard showcasing trends in EV adoption, charging infrastructure, and vehicle performance.

🚗⚡ElectroDrive Insights : Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
A Power BI dashboard designed to analyze survival outcomes and key health indicators in heart disease patients.

### 2. Short Description / Purpose

The ElectroDrive Insights Dashboard offers an interactive analytical view of electric vehicle trends. It allows users to explore how factors such as EV type (BEV/PHEV), state-level adoption, model year, vehicle make, and CAFV eligibility impact the distribution and growth of electric vehicles.
This dashboard supports researchers, policymakers, and industry analysts in understanding EV market behavior and making data-driven decisions

### 3. Tech Stack
   
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
• 📊 Tableau Desktop – Primary data visualization tool for creating dashboards.<br>
• 📁 Excel/CSV Dataset – Used as the data source for EV attributes.<br>
• 🛠 Tableau Calculated Fields – Created for KPIs, growth values, percentages, and eligibility categories.<br>
• ⚙️ Data Cleaning – Performed inside Tableau and Excel for standardizing fields and improving data quality.<br>
• 🎨 Design & Layout Tools – Tableau containers, objects, and formatting for a clean UI.<br>
• 📁 File Format – .twbx for development and .png for dashboard previews.

### 4. Data Source

Dataset sourced from publicly available Electric Vehicle (EV) registration datasets (State EV Registries, Kaggle, Public EV Programs).

The dataset includes details such as:<br>
• Vehicle make and model<br>
• Model year<br>
• EV type (BEV/PHEV)<br>
• CAFV eligibility<br>
• Electric range<br>
• State-level adoption counts

Data preparation included:<br>
• Removing duplicates<br>
• Standardizing make and model names<br>
• Assigning EV type groups<br>
• Creating total count and percentage fields<br>
• Mapping state-level vehicle distribution

### 5. Features and Highlights

### Business Problem

Government agencies, car manufacturers, and EV marketers lack a clear visual representation of EV adoption trends. Understanding which regions and models lead EV adoption is essential for planning charging infrastructure, product strategy, and policy decisions.

### Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a visual tool that highlights:<br>
• Top EV models and manufacturers<br>
• Annual EV adoption trends<br>
• EV distribution across U.S. states<br>
• CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility categories<br>
• EV type comparison (BEV vs PHEV)<br>
• Average electric range<br>
This dashboard assists in evaluating market performance and identifying opportunities for EV expansion.

### Key Visuals Explained

### • KPI Cards

• Total Vehicles<br>
• Total BEV Vehicles<br>
• Total PHEV Vehicles<br>
• Average Electric Range<br>

These KPIs offer a high-level snapshot of EV market status.
